## Project Description
Video preview of the project:

The idea is that we have one `master` project that can share its screen. The screensharing is established via .NET SignalR websockets. The `slave` are the user/s that will watch the `master` screen.  

On the video we can see the `master` on the left side and the `slave` on the right side. One `master` can have many `slaves` or users that will observe his screen. The `slave` can only watch and can't resize, scroll or modify any input elements. If the `master` resizes, scrolls or changes any input elements, the `slaves` screen is dynamically changed.
